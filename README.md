# Set-up instructions for local testing

1. Clone the repo.
2. In the root directory, run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
3. Create `.env` file with the environment variables.
4. In the root directory, run `npx prisma generate` followed by `npx prisma studio` to setup the database. Take note that school/home wifi might not work. Changing to data will solve the issue.
5. In the root directory, run `npm run dev`.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. Create `.env` file with `DATABASE_URL`
2. `yarn`

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

For prisma:
To create tables in database after creating schema, run

```bsh
npx prisma db push
```

After updating database, run

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

To pull new changes from database, run

```bash
npx prisma db pull
```

To view db GUI, run

```bash
npx prisma studio
```
